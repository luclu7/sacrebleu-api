# Sacrebleu-API 

## NOT READY 

The API server which interacts with the [sacrebleu-dns DNS server](https://github.com/outout14/sacrebleu-dns) database to create/modify/delete records with token based authentification.

This software interacts directly with the SQL database and does not need to be on a server with ``sacrebleu-dns``.
